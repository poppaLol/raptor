"""P3-C-01 / W2-1 (2026-06-02 review): WallBudgetExceeded + NoProgressReached,
when raised by on_message, must be caught by ``_run_query_once._consume`` as a
CLEAN early-stop (exactly like GiveUpReceived / TurnCapReached / BudgetCapExceeded)
— NOT propagate out into ``run_agent``'s broad ``except`` retry loop, which burns
~2 wasted SDK subprocess retries + duplicate audit rows before the build() handler
finally classifies them. The final OutcomeStatus is unchanged (NoProgress ->
turn_cap via 'max_turns_reached'; Wall -> budget_exhausted via 'budget_exceeded');
the build() exception-handler elifs stay as a defensive backstop.

RED until the ``except (WallBudgetExceeded, NoProgressReached)`` clause exists in
_consume: today they propagate, so _run_query_once raises instead of returning a
clean early-stop outcome.
