"""Phase 47.C (2026-05-17) — Phase 7.3 trigger extension for docker_build path.

Current Phase 7.3 classifier (src/cve_env/agent/loop.py:819-835) emits
`stuck_after_launch` triage marker on turn_cap when:
  state.launched_ok AND not state.verify_attempted

`launched_ok` is set when docker_run/compose_up.ok=True (loop.py:1174).
CVEs that succeed `docker_build` but NEVER call docker_run get plain
`turn_cap` with no triage marker — a gap.

Empirical evidence: CVE-2024-12828 in Phase 43 partial
(`output/bench/bench50-20260517-005503/CVE-2024-12828.json`):
  tool_names_called includes docker_build (5×) but NOT docker_run
  status=turn_cap, reason=max_turns_reached (no stuck marker)

Phase 47.C extends the trigger to:
  (state.launched_ok OR state.docker_built_ok) AND not state.verify_attempted

With a distinct reason marker `stuck_after_launch_after_build` when the
trigger fires on docker_built_ok only (not launched_ok). Per past-bench-
lessons §M-class: TRIAGE-ENRICHMENT not behavior-change — same terminal
status, richer reason for analysis.

Per past-bench-lessons §1 — TDD with RED test first.
