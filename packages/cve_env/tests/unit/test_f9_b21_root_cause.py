"""Stage 5b — root-cause TDD for F-9 anomaly + B-21 ineffectiveness.

Migration-arc audit (Stage 4 bench50-20260508-003044) reproduced the B-21
premature-halt symptom (CVE-2022-31945 hit max_turns_reached at num_turns=34)
and surfaced an F-9 anomaly from earlier bench data: state.turn=250 reached
in CVE-2022-31945's audit JSONL despite ``effective_max_turns=96``.

These tests drive on_message far beyond the configured max_turns to verify
F-9 actually raises TurnCapReached at the expected message count. If they
fail, F-9 is wiring-broken (NOT just B-21 ineffective) and the migration
arc has a deeper bug.
