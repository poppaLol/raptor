"""BUG-1 (trace br-7e06a0b-costfloor): cost telemetry under-reports on a
non-clean exit (turn_cap / max_turns_reached) when the SDK reports neither a
plausible cost nor token usage — the Claude Code session-auth case, where
``usage`` is ``None`` on every message and the interrupted-run ResultMessage
carries an implausibly-low ``total_cost_usd``.

At HEAD the terminal Outcome floors ``total_cost_usd`` on
``max(last_cost_usd, token_estimate)`` only; with token usage absent the
estimate is 0 and the cost collapses to the SDK's low value while ``num_turns``
(from the authoritative ``state.turn``) stays correct — e.g. a 46-turn build
logged ``$0.013``.

Fix: a turns-based cost floor, gated to non-clean exits + absent token usage,
so correctly-reported ``success`` runs and API-key (token-bearing) runs are
untouched.
