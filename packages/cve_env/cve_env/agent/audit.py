"""Per-CVE agent audit-log writer.

Split from event telemetry: stuffing full prompts + responses into a
bounded event stream balloons the event file to GB scale and operators
``rm -rf output/`` -- losing the run-level summary alongside the LLM
transcripts. Split the two:

* ``output/agentic/<run_id>/<cve_id>.jsonl`` -- one file per CVE; owner
  of the full agentic payload (each turn's tool call, tool result, cost,
  token usage). Append-only. Deleting one CVE's trace is cheap and does
  not lose the run summary.
* (Optional future) ``output/monitor/events.jsonl`` -- bounded event
  stream for dashboards. Not implemented in v0.1.

Design choices:

* One :class:`AuditWriter` per run. ``run_id`` is baked in at
  construction so every turn writes under the same run directory.
* Append-only. Each ``write`` serializes to a single JSON line. We never
  rewrite or truncate -- forensic value depends on full history.
* Fail-loud on I/O errors. If the agent runs and we cannot trace it, the
  attribution join downstream is corrupt. Let the exception propagate.

The stage Literal is an open string (tool names vary per run) and the
status Literal is restricted to agent-loop outcomes.

"""Agent-visible outcomes of a single audit entry.

One ``tool_ok`` per successful tool call, one ``llm_turn`` per LLM
request, terminal ``final_*`` exactly once per CVE.

``final_no_verify`` is emitted when the SDK ends with
``stop_reason='end_turn'`` AND verify wasn't passed AND no give_up was
issued — labeling silent end_turns distinctly rather than mislabeling
them ``final_turn_cap`` (no turn cap fired in that case).

``recovery`` is emitted alongside the ordinary ``tool_ok`` when a
build-path tool succeeds within ``RECOVERY_GAP_TURNS`` turns of a
same-tool failure. Lets post-bench analysis count recovery events without
scripted forensic over raw tool_ok / tool_error pairs.

``post_build_refusal`` is emitted when the SDK throws a refusal-class
exception AFTER ``state.launched_ok`` is True, i.e., the agent reached
docker_run/compose_up success but the verify-plan composition (or a
downstream tool input) tripped Anthropic's safety classifier. Distinct
from research-phase refusals (NVD-description trigger handled by the
sanitizer). Paired with the prompts.py open-clause verify-plan
composition rule.

``force_resolve_continuation`` is emitted by the build-engagement gate.
``benign_verify_continuation`` is emitted when a post-launch refusal
blocked verify and the env-gated benign-verify continuation resumes the
session with a benign-only verify prompt.

``proprietary_verify_continuation`` is emitted when the env-gated
proprietary-verify continuation resumes the session because the agent gave
up ``proprietary`` WITHOUT an image_resolve probe — verify-the-negative
against the open-source-by-proprietary-vendor false-positive class. Locked
by ``test_proprietary_verify_continuation`` +
