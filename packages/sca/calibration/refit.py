"""Calibration refitter — grid search over multiplier constants.

When the validator's verdict is ``needs_retune``, this module
grid-searches each tunable multiplier in :mod:`packages.sca.risk`
for a value that improves top-20 precision against the calibration
corpus, subject to a max-delta cap and an improvement gate.

## Why grid search rather than logistic regression?

The risk formula in ``risk.py`` is multiplicative:

    score = (cvss/10)*100 × kev_mult × epss_mult × reach_mult × ...

Logistic regression would assume additive log-odds; mapping the
fitted coefficients back to specific named constants is fuzzy
(each constant flows through different parts of the formula).
Grid search, by contrast:

  * Directly evaluates each constant in terms of the metric we
    care about (top-20 precision).
  * Each step is interpretable: "we tried K=1.20, K=1.08, K=1.32;
    K=1.08 had best precision."
  * Pure-Python — no numpy / sklearn dependency. Refit is a
    monthly CI job; install cost matters.
  * Captures interactions implicitly: each per-constant search
    runs against the SAME live formula (with all other constants
    at current values), so the chosen value is best given the
    rest of the formula as-is.

## Algorithm

For each tunable constant C in ``risk.TUNABLE_CONSTANTS``:

    1. Compute top-20 precision with all current constants.
       Call this ``baseline``.
    2. Compute precision with C overridden at C × 0.9, C × 1.1.
       Call these ``low``, ``high``.
    3. Pick the variant with highest precision. Apply the
       max-delta cap (already enforced by the ±10% bracket).
    4. If the chosen variant ties baseline, leave C unchanged.

## Improvement gate

After per-constant search, run validation with all proposed
overrides applied AT ONCE. If overall top-20 precision improvement
is < ``improvement_threshold`` (default 5%), reject the refit —
return a report flagging it but not proposing changes.

## Sample-count floor

The refitter refuses to run with fewer than ``MIN_SAMPLES_FOR_REFIT``
labelled findings. Below that, return verdict=``insufficient_samples``;
the corpus needs to grow before a refit is meaningful.
