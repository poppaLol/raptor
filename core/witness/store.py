"""Hash-addressed persistence for :class:`~core.witness.types.Witness`
records and their underlying bytes.

Storage layout under the configured root directory::

    {root}/
        manifests/
            <sha256>.json          # Witness.to_dict() per witness
        blobs/
            <sha256>.bin           # raw bytes (de-duplicated by hash)
        index.json                 # listing of all known hashes

Same bytes seen by multiple pipelines collapse to a single blob —
the hash key naturally de-duplicates. Two ``Witness`` records can
share a single ``blobs/<sha256>.bin`` if their bytes happen to
match; each has its own manifest with its own provenance.

The store is process-local: no concurrent-writer locking. Each
pipeline run gets its own ``{out_dir}/witnesses/`` root, so
concurrent runs on the same host don't collide. Within a single
run, callers are expected to be sequential — same as the existing
finding-record producers in the project.

    ``{run_out_dir}/witnesses/`` so each pipeline run's witnesses
    cluster together.

    Operations:

    * :meth:`put` — store bytes + an associated Witness; idempotent
      on (hash, source, observed_outcome, produced_by) — putting a
      duplicate is a no-op for the blob and overwrites the manifest
      with the most recent record (timestamps cumulate via the
      index).

    * :meth:`get_witness` — load a Witness record by hash.
    * :meth:`list_witnesses` — iterate every Witness in the store.
    * :meth:`has` — quick existence check.

    Failures (missing file, malformed JSON) raise
    :class:`WitnessStoreError`. The store does *not* swallow errors
    silently — a caller that gets a Witness back can rely on its
