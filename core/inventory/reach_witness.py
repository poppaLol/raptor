"""Proof-carrying reachability verdicts.

The reachability accessors return string verdicts (``classify_reachability``
in :mod:`core.inventory.reach_audit`). This module wraps that into a
structured :class:`ReachabilityVerdict` carrying a *witness* — the kind of
evidence and its *soundness* — and a single ``may_suppress()`` predicate
that is the ONLY thing allowed to authorise hard-suppression of a finding
on reachability grounds.

Why a soundness axis: a verdict produced by structural facts that hold
under every build configuration (``raise ImportError`` at module top,
``if False:`` guard) is a proof; one produced by a 1-hop call-edge
heuristic (``not_called``) or an entry-completeness assumption
(``no_path_from_entry`` — see its known address-of limitation) is evidence,
not proof. Only proof may suppress.

Important: the ``soundness`` label here is the *candidate* class. Actual
enforce-eligibility is gated empirically — a witness kind earns the right
to suppress only once a labelled corpus shows zero false-suppress for it
(see :mod:`core.inventory.reach_audit`). This module defines the chokepoint;
the enforcement consumer wires it together with the corpus gate. Today no
consumer hard-suppresses — the substrate is surface-only.
