"""Named sandbox profile definitions.

Profiles are the ONLY legitimate way for a user to downgrade isolation.
They map a human-memorable name onto a coherent set of layer settings.
Kept in a tiny standalone module so both `cli.py` (for argparse choices)
and `context.py` (for profile resolution in sandbox()) can import them
without a circular dependency.

Wrapped in MappingProxyType because `PROFILES` is exposed via __all__ —
a plain dict would let an external caller mutate `PROFILES["full"]
["block_network"] = False` and corrupt the module for every subsequent
sandbox() invocation in the process.

# Profile definitions
# -------------------
# Profiles set ENFORCEMENT strictness. Audit mode is an ORTHOGONAL
# concern engaged by the `--audit` CLI flag (or `audit=True` kwarg)
# and works with any profile that has a seccomp filter (i.e. full or
# debug); on `network-only` it engages only the egress-proxy log-mode
# gate (the other audit layers are no-ops because there's no Landlock
# / seccomp to compare against), and on `none` it errors as
# incoherent.
#
# full:         network blocked + Landlock + seccomp (incl. ptrace) + rlimits.
#               The default. Appropriate for scan/exploit/PoC work. If the
#               host lacks an isolation backend it warns and degrades.
# strict:       same policy intent as full, but fail-closed if the host cannot
#               provide the platform isolation backend. On Linux target/output
#               isolation also requires mount namespaces.
# target_run:   posture for spawning a harness-authored target binary
#               that needs to expose a local listener (loopback TCP, UDS,
#               etc.). Same Landlock + seccomp posture as ``full`` but
#               ``block_network=False`` so the listener is reachable to
#               the spawning harness. Callers that want isolation FROM
#               the host's loopback (not just FROM the wider network)
#               pair this profile with ``core/sandbox/
#               netns_coordinator.py`` to put the listener in a shared
#               isolated net-ns; the coordinator overrides
#               ``block_network=True`` + ``inherit_netns=True`` per call,
#               so the profile's loopback setting is irrelevant on that
#               path. Defence-in-depth still comes from Landlock (caller
#               passes ``allowed_tcp_ports=[port]`` per call) and seccomp.
# debug:        full, but seccomp permits ptrace so gdb/rr can trace the
#               target. Use for /crash-analysis. Target AND debugger run
#               in the same sandbox — debugger forks target as a descendant
#               so ptrace_scope=1 naturally authorises the trace.
#               Composes with --audit so operators can see what would
#               have been blocked while still running gdb/rr.
# frida:        debug + AF_UNIX sockets allowed (frida-helper uses Unix
#               domain sockets for its internal IPC with the target
#               process). AF_NETLINK/AF_PACKET/SOCK_RAW stay blocked.
# network-only: network blocked + rlimits only (no Landlock, no seccomp).
#               For tools whose correctness requires unrestricted fs or
#               syscalls within a build — user's last-resort-short-of-none.
# none:         rlimits only. Emergency escape hatch.
#
# `seccomp` is the profile name passed into _make_seccomp_preexec(); an
# empty string disables seccomp for that profile. The two audit fields
# moved out of the profile dict to CLI flags / per-call kwargs.
